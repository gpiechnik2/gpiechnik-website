## Path travelsal vulnerability

Dive deep into the world of path traversal vulnerabilities, a seemingly innocuous yet potent threat that can grant unauthorized access to confidential files and folders. By simply manipulating parameters, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to not only expose sensitive data but, in some cases, execute remote code.

🔑 Inside this guide, you'll uncover:

- A straightforward breakdown of path traversal vulnerabilities and how they can be exploited using simple manipulations like “../../”.
- The various defense mechanisms, such as WAF, that websites deploy to guard against these vulnerabilities, and how they can sometimes be bypassed.
- A detailed look at sample payloads that can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities and their encoded representations.
- Real-world examples that highlight the persistence of path traversal vulnerabilities in both legacy and modern technologies.
- A deep dive into specific cases, from the dangers of improper validation in server-side rendered pages to the lethal combination of open redirect and path traversal vulnerabilities leading to SSRF.
- An exploration of the kramdown library's vulnerability, a popular Ruby library used by platforms like Github Pages and Jekyll, and how it was exploited for remote code execution.
- Tips and tools for automating the detection of these vulnerabilities, with a spotlight on the powerful dot2moon tool.

Whether you're a cybersecurity enthusiast, a web developer, or just curious about the hidden threats lurking in the digital realm, this guide offers a comprehensive exploration of path traversal vulnerabilities, equipping you with the knowledge to defend against them.
