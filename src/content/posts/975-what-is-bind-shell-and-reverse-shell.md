- Bind Shell: Explore how an attacker's machine acts as a client, connecting to a victim's machine, which acts as a server, to execute remote commands.
-Reverse Shell: Discover the inverse of bind shell, where the victim's machine initiates the connection to the attacker's server.
- Practical Payloads: Dive into a hands-on example using a reverse shell payload to create a connection.

📌 Key Takeaways:

- Grasp the distinction between bind shell and reverse shell.
- Understand the role of the attacker and victim in each scenario.
