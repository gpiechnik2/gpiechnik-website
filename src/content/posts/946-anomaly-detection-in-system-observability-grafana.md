## Better anomaly detection in system observability and performance testing with Grafana k6

I have exciting news to share! ðŸŽ‰ My article on automated anomaly detection in k6 using the xk6-anomaly extension has just been published on the Grafana blog! I am truly thrilled to have delved into this innovative topic and share my findings with the broader community.

Automated anomaly detection is a key step towards more advanced performance analysis, and the xk6-anomaly extension opens up new possibilities in this area. If you are as fascinated by this topic as I am, I encourage you to read my article!
